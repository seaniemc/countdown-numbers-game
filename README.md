The aim of the project is to re-create the countdown numbers game, as seeen on the channel 4 TV show countdown using the programming 
language Racket.  The contestnat is allowed to select 6 numbers at random from 2 different sets of numbers "big" and "small".  
The big set contains the numbers {25, 50, 75, 100}  
The small set contains the numbers {1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 8 , 8 , 9 , 9 , 10 , 10} From 1 - 10.  
The contestant can take as many numbers as they want from the big (from one -> all four) and the remaing numbers are then taken from 
the "small" set.
