The aim of the project is to re-create the countdown numbers game, as seeen on the channel 4 TV show countdown using the programming 
language Racket.  The contestnat is allowed to select 6 numbers at random from 2 different sets of numbers "big" and "small".  
The big set contains the numbers {25, 50, 75, 100}  
The small set contains the numbers {1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 8 , 8 , 9 , 9 , 10 , 10} From 1 - 10.  
The contestant can take as many numbers as they want from the big (from one -> all four) and the remaing numbers are then taken from 
the "small" set. 
A number between 101 - 999 is randomly generated, which the contestant is then asked to calculate this number using the selected numbers from the "big" and "small" sets. The contestant can reach the chosen target by using just the four basic arithmetic operators + - ร รท.
