**Summary**
------------------
The objective of this application was to replicate the countdown numbers game using the programming language Racket. The game is simple to understand the contestant chooses at random 6 numbers from 2 sets containing small numbers and big numbers. Then they are given a random number, which they have to calculate using the given small and large numbers. 
There is a **Wiki** for this repo which explains in greater detail the workings of the game and the process in which the game was developed.
